## Welcome to microFHIR!

This website is intended to help bring FHIR to resource constrained microcontroller based medical devices, in a way that such devices can interact with a FHIR server directly.

For general information on FHIR click [here](https://fhir.org), for the FHIR documentation click [here](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/).
